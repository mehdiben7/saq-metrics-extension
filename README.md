## Disclaimers

### Non-affiliation

Neither I nor any potential contributor is associated with the Société des alcools du Québec (SAQ) or any of its subsidiaries. The same goes for the Quebec government, which has no connection with us. The SAQ neither condemns nor supports this extension, which is purely a figment of my imagination.

### Alcohol

This extension is a simple little project. I in no way encourage the consumption of alcohol, especially not excessively. Alcohol is actually very bad for your health.

If you have any issues with addiction, whether to alcohol or other drugs, please refer to

1. If you are in Quebec, [Drogue: aide et référence](https://www.aidedrogue.ca/).
2. If you are located elsewhere in Canada, [the Canadian government's page on the subject](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/substance-use/get-help-with-substance-use.html).
